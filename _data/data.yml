    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I began my programming journey in high school, diving into algorithmic competitions and embracing each challenge with enthusiasm,
      leading to a bronze medal in the Polish Olympiad in Informatics. This passion for problem-solving continued through my Computer Science studies,
      inspiring me to start a professional career in web application development in my second year of university.
      It was here that I discovered a deep interest in Android development. I'm particularly proud of a well-received photo editing app for Android,
      a project that was both challenging and fulfilling. Now, I work as a mobile frontend developer at a software house.
      As a developer, my focus is always on delivering practical solutions that are cost-efficient and centered around user needs,
      ensuring that each project meets both user and business expectations.
